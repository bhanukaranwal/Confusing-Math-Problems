# Problem 20 — Sparse Topological Graphs with Minimal Chromatic Homologies and Spectral Gaps

## Problem Statement

Let $n$ ($7 \leq n \leq 16$) be an integer. Consider the set $\mathcal{G}(n,k)$ of all simple, connected, undirected graphs with $n$ vertices and exactly $k$ edges, where $n-1 \leq k \leq \binom{n}{2}$ (i.e., between spanning trees and complete graphs).

For a graph $G \in \mathcal{G}(n,k)$, define:

1. **Clique Chromatic Number $\chi_C(G)$:** The minimum number of colors needed to color all vertices such that no maximal clique of size $\geq 2$ is monochromatic.
2. **Topological Homology Rank $H_1(G)$:** The rank of the first homology group of $G$ considered as a $1$-dimensional simplicial complex (i.e., the number of independent cycles).
3. **Spectral Gap $g(G)$:** The difference between the two largest distinct eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of $G$.

Your tasks:

- For given $n$ and $k$, **construct a graph $G$ in $\mathcal{G}(n, k)$ such that:**
    - The clique chromatic number $\chi_C(G)$ is minimized.
    - Subject to this, $H_1(G)$ is maximized.
    - Subject to both, the spectral gap $g(G)$ is maximized.
- Output:
    - The adjacency list of $G$ (one vertex per line: list neighbors in ascending order).
    - The values of $\chi_C(G)$, $H_1(G)$, and $g(G)$.
    - A step-by-step justification of how you constructed $G$ and verified optimality per constraints.

## Input

- Two integers: $n~k$ ($7 \leq n \leq 16$, $n-1 \leq k \leq \binom{n}{2}$)

---

## Output

- $n$ lines: adjacency lists (each line $i$ is neighbors of vertex $i$, sorted ascending)
- Next line: clique chromatic number $\chi_C(G)$
- Next line: homology rank $H_1(G)$
- Next line: spectral gap $g(G)$ (with at least 7 significant digits)
- Next section: Justification (explain the choices at each step—why chromatic number is minimal, how homology is maximized, why spectral gap is large)

### Notes

- Cliques: maximal complete subgraphs; coloring must avoid monochromatic cliques.
- Homology: rank is $k - n + 1$ (number of cycles in connected graph).
- Spectral gap: difference of largest two eigenvalues of adjacency matrix (excluding equal ones).
