# Problem 3 — Recursive Polynomial Codes and Unique Arrays

## Problem Statement

Let $N$ be a positive integer ($2 \leq N \leq 17$).  
Consider all arrays $A = [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N]$ where each $a_i$ is a positive integer ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6$) and all $a_i$ are distinct.

Define the **recursive polynomial code** $f(A)$ as follows:

- $f_0(x) = 1$ (identity)
- For $i$ from $1$ to $N$: $f_i(x) = \mathrm{gcd}(f_{i-1}(x), x^2 - a_i x + 1)$
- The final code for $A$ is $f_N(x)$.

You are to construct a family $\mathcal{F}$ of arrays $(A^{(1)}, A^{(2)}, \dots, A^{(M)})$, with these properties:

- For each array $A^{(j)}$, all entries are distinct, $1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6$.
- For any $1 \leq j < k \leq M$, $f_N^{(j)}(x)$ and $f_N^{(k)}(x)$ are coprime as polynomials over the integers (i.e., their $\gcd$ is 1 as polynomials).
- No two arrays are permutations of one another.

Your task:

- Given $N$, construct such a family $\mathcal{F}$ of **maximum size** $M$.
- Output $M$ and each $A$ in $\mathcal{F}$ as a sequence of $N$ integers, space-separated.

## Input

- Single integer $N~$ ($2 \leq N \leq 17$)

---

## Output

- First line: integer $M$ (the size of your family)
- Next $M$ lines: each line is $N$ space-separated distinct positive integers between $1$ and $10^6$ (an array in the family)

### Notes

- You may select any arrays obeying the rules—the maximal family is required.
- There may be many possible answers.

---

## Constraints

- Entries must be distinct positive integers between $1$ and $10^6$.
- No array may be a permutation of another in the family.
- For every pair of arrays, their recursive polynomial codes must be coprime.

## Further Explanation and Requirements

You must:

- For each array, recursively build its polynomial code $f_N(x)$ as described.
- Check coprimality of all pairs in the family.
- Arrays may differ by more than just order!
- Maximize $M$; output any maximal valid family.
