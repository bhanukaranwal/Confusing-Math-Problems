# Problem 15 â€” Maximal Families of Orthogonal Latin Hypercubes with Algebraic Constraints

## Problem Statement

A **Latin hypercube** of dimension $d$ and order $n$ ($2 \leq d \leq 5$, $2 \leq n \leq 8$) is a $d$-dimensional $n \times n \times \cdots \times n$ array filled with integers from $1$ to $n$, such that each "line" parallel to any axis contains all numbers from $1$ to $n$ exactly once.

Two Latin hypercubes $H$ and $H'$ of the same dimension and order are called **orthogonal** if, when superimposed, the ordered pairs $(H[x_1, \dots, x_d], H'[x_1, \dots, x_d])$ contain all $n^d$ distinct pairs exactly once.

Let $X = \{H_1, H_2, ..., H_m\}$ be a family of pairwise orthogonal Latin hypercubes of dimension $d$ and order $n$.

Suppose each hypercube $H_i$ is associated with an algebraic polynomial $P_i(x)$ of degree at most $d$, constructed such that:

- The roots of $P_i(x)$ correspond to sums of values along main diagonals of $H_i$.
- For any $i \neq j$, the polynomials $P_i(x)$ and $P_j(x)$ are pairwise coprime over the integers.
- Additionally, the family $X$ satisfies that **for every fixed coordinate $k$** ($1 \leq k \leq d$), the sums of $P_i(x)$ evaluated at $k$-th axis slices are all distinct across $i$.

Your tasks:

1. Given $d$ and $n$, **construct the largest possible family $X$ of pairwise orthogonal Latin hypercubes** satisfying the above polynomial coprimality and distinct slice sums.

2. Output:

   - The size $m$ of the maximal family,
   - For each hypercube $H_i$ in $X$:
     - A listing of hypercube entries in a flattened lexicographic order,
     - The coefficients of the associated polynomial $P_i(x)$,
   - Verification details showing pairwise coprimality of $P_i(x)$,
   - Proof sketch or algorithmic reasoning explaining the maximality and algebraic properties fulfilled.

## Input

- Two integers: $d~n$ ($2 \leq d \leq 5$, $2 \leq n \leq 8$).

---

## Output

- First line: integer $m$ (size of the maximal family).
- Next $m$ blocks, each describing a hypercube and its polynomial:
  - One line: flattened hypercube of length $n^d$ (space-separated integers from $1$ to $n$).
  - One line: polynomial coefficients of $P_i(x)$, from highest degree to constant term.
- After all hypercubes, output a verification section confirming:
  - Pairwise orthogonality,
  - Polynomial coprimality,
  - Distinct slice sum conditions.

### Notes

- Constructing even one Latin square (2D hypercube) is classical; building maximal orthogonal families with algebraic polynomial constraints is significantly more complex.
- Polynomial $P_i(x)$ may be formed, e.g., by $\prod_j (x - S_{i,j})$ where $S_{i,j}$ is the sum of entries along main diagonals or specified slices.
- The constraints on polynomials ensure deep algebraic independence beyond classical orthogonality.
- The problem combines combinatorial design, algebra, and computational number theory.

## Constraints

- $2 \leq d \leq 5$
- $2 \leq n \leq 8$
- Polynomials have integer coefficients.
- Computational feasibility limits explicit constructions but requires algorithmic reasoning.

---

## Further Explanation and Requirements

- You must enumerate or algorithmically generate Latin hypercubes meeting the Latin hypercube and orthogonality definitions.
- Define polynomial $P_i(x)$ associated to each hypercube by sums on major diagonals or other algebraic invariants.
- Ensure pairwise coprimality of $P_i(x)$ and distinct slice sum properties.
- Maximize the family size and provide an explicit constructive or verification proof.
- Output format includes hypercube entries, polynomial coefficients, and verification.
