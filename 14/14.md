# Problem 14 â€” Partitioning Permutations by Disjoint Cycle Families

## Problem Statement

Let $n$ ($4 \leq n \leq 9$) be a positive integer.  
Let $S_n$ denote the set of all permutations of $\{1, 2, \dots, n\}$.

For each permutation $\sigma \in S_n$, consider its **cycle decomposition**: the set of cycles into which $\sigma$ decomposes (cycle type).

You are to construct a family $\mathcal{F}$ of permutations with the following properties:

- For any two distinct permutations $\sigma, \tau \in \mathcal{F}$, **no cycle in the decomposition of $\sigma$ shares any element with a cycle in the decomposition of $\tau$** (i.e., for every $i$ in $[1,n]$, the cycles containing $i$ in $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are always in different permutations; $\mathcal{F}$ is pairwise cycle-disjoint).
- Each permutation in $\mathcal{F}$ must **not be the identity**, and must have at least two cycles in its decomposition (e.g., for $n=5$, $(1\ 2)(3\ 4\ 5)$ is acceptable, $(1\ 2\ 3\ 4\ 5)$ is not).

Your task:

- Given $n$, **find the largest possible size $t$ of $\mathcal{F}$ and construct such a family explicitly**.
- Output $t$, and then each permutation as a list of cycles (cycle notation: each cycle in parentheses, elements in increasing order within each cycle, cycles sorted by smallest element).

## Input

- Single line: integer $n$ ($4 \leq n \leq 9$)

---

## Output

- First line: $t$ (largest possible family size).
- Next $t$ lines: Each line is a permutation written as its cycle decomposition:
    - Each cycle is printed as $(a_1\ a_2\ ...\ a_k)$ (elements ascending),
    - Cycles separated by spaces,
    - Cycles sorted by their smallest element.

### Notes

- Each permutation must be non-identity (no fixed points for all elements) and must decompose into at least two cycles.
- No two permutations in the family may have cycles that share any integer.
- For each element $i$, it is included in a cycle in only one permutation.
- Any family satisfying maximal cardinality is accepted.

## Constraints

- $4 \leq n \leq 9$

## Further Explanation and Requirements

To solve, you must:

- Enumerate possible non-identity permutations with appropriate cycle decompositions,
- Build the largest family such that their cycles' supports are pairwise disjoint,
- Print each permutation in explicit cycle notation.
