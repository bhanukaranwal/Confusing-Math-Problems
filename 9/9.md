# Problem 9 â€” Minimal Solutions to Functional Integer Sequence Equations

## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer $n$ ($4 \leq n \leq 14$).  
Consider all sequences $A = [a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$ of $n$ positive integers ($1 \leq a_i \leq 100$), **all distinct**, such that the following holds for every $1 \leq i < n$:

$$
a_{i+1} = f(a_i, a_{i-1})
$$

where $f(x, y)$ is the following functional equation:
$$
f(x, y) = \min \{k \in \mathbb{N}^+ \mid k > y \ \text{and} \ \gcd(k, x) = 1 \}
$$
with the convention $a_0 = 0$.

Your task:

- Find the **lex smallest** sequence $A$ of distinct integers in $[1, 100]$ for given $n$ such that the equation holds for every position (i.e., $a_{i+1}$ is generated from $a_i$ and $a_{i-1}$ as described, and all numbers are distinct in $A$).
- Output the sequence as $n$ space-separated integers.

---

## Input

- Single integer: $n$ ($4 \leq n \leq 14$)

---

## Output

- One line: $n$ space-separated positive integers $a_1, ..., a_n$ (lex minimum valid sequence satisfying the rules).

### Notes

- $a_1$ is arbitrary; $a_2$ must use $a_1$ and $a_0=0$; $a_3$ uses $a_2$ and $a_1$, etc.
- For each step, compute the minimal $k > a_{i-1}$ with $\gcd(k, a_i) = 1$ and $k$ not yet in the sequence.
- The solution must be lexicographically minimal among all valid sequences.

---

## Constraints

- $4 \leq n \leq 14$
- $1 \leq a_i \leq 100$, all $a_i$ are distinct

## Further Explanation and Requirements

You must:

- For a given $n$, systematically construct the lex smallest valid sequence,
- Use functional recursion and minimality,
- Respect all distinctness constraints.
