# Problem 6 — Weighted Independent Sets in Graphic Matroids

## Problem Statement

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a simple undirected graph with $n$ nodes ($3 \leq n \leq 10$) and $m$ edges ($2 \leq m \leq n(n-1)/2$).  
Each edge $e$ is assigned a positive integer weight $w_e$ ($1 \leq w_e \leq 10^5$).

Consider the **graphic matroid** $\mathcal{M}(G)$: the ground set is $E$, and a set of edges $S \subseteq E$ is **independent** if it contains no cycles (i.e., forms a forest).

Your task:

- Find the **maximum weight independent set** in $\mathcal{M}(G)$ (i.e., a subset of edges with no cycles, with maximal total edge weight).
- Output the total weight, the number of edges $k$ in your independent set, and the list of edges in your solution (as $u~v~w_e$ for each edge, in any order).

## Input

- First line: $n~m$ ($3 \leq n \leq 10$, $2 \leq m \leq n(n-1)/2$)
- Next $m$ lines: $u~v~w_e$ ($1$-based indices for endpoints, weight for the edge)

---

## Output

- First line: integer $W$ (total weight of selected independent set)
- Second line: integer $k$ (number of edges in your set)
- Next $k$ lines: each line is $u~v~w_e$ (an edge in your set, endpoints and weight, any order)

### Notes

- Your selected edges must form a forest—no cycles.
- Output any valid maximal-weight independent set (edges in any order).
- For a connected graph, this is the maximum weight spanning tree; but graphs need not be connected.

## Constraints

- $3 \leq n \leq 10$
- $2 \leq m \leq n(n-1)/2$

## Further Explanation and Requirements

You must:

- Find a maximum-weight forest in the graph (greedy algorithms like Kruskal's are optimal),
- Output the weight, edge count, and edge list.
