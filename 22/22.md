# Problem 22 — Computing Higher Grothendieck–Witt Groups and Universal Quadratic Representatives

## Problem Statement

Let $R = \mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ be the ring of integers of the quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a square-free integer ($2 \leq |d| \leq 40$, $d \neq 0,1$).

Define a **quadratic form** $q : M \to R$ on a finitely generated $R$-module $M$, represented by a symmetric matrix $Q$ with entries in $R$.

Consider the **Grothendieck–Witt group** $GW^i(R)$, the $i$‑th hermitian K‑group, for $i = 0,1,2$.

Your tasks:

1. For given $d$, compute generators (up to isomorphism) of $GW^0(R)$ and $GW^1(R)$.
    - List each generator as a symmetric matrix $Q$ (entries as $a + b\sqrt{d}$), size $n \times n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 5$).
    - For each, output its determinant, rank, and whether it is isotropic over $R$.

2. Find a **universal quadratic form** of minimal rank $m$ that *represents all elements of $R$ of norm at most $N$* ($1 \leq N \leq 70$).
    - Output $m$ and the matrix $U$ representing the universal form (symmetrically).
    - For every $r \in R$ with $|\mathrm{Norm}(r)| \leq N$, output whether $r = U(v)$ for some $v \in R^m$.

3. For $GW^2(R)$, enumerate representatives of the form classes realizing different *second Stiefel–Whitney classes*, and output their matrices and the corresponding invariants (Witt index, Arf invariant, etc).

### Notes

- Computing $GW^i(R)$ requires deep algebraic and algorithmic understanding; generators should be chosen up to stable isomorphism.
- Universal quadratic forms are those that can represent all “small” norms in the ring (minimize rank).
- Witt index and Arf invariant encode classical quadratic properties; Stiefel–Whitney class reflects topology of associated vector bundle.

## Constraints

- $2 \leq |d| \leq 40$, $d$ square-free, $d \neq 0,1$
- $1 \leq N \leq 70$
- All matrices must be symmetric with entries in $R$
- Output must include explicit calculations for each piece
