# Problem 9 — Maximal Trace-Free Submatrix Selection

## Problem Statement

Let $A$ be an $n \times n$ matrix of integers ($2 \leq n \leq 10$), where each entry $a_{i,j}$ ($1 \leq a_{i,j} \leq 10^5$).  
You are tasked with selecting a subset $S$ of rows and a subset $T$ of columns (each of size $k$, $2 \leq k \leq n$), such that the $k \times k$ submatrix $B$ formed by rows in $S$ and columns in $T$ has:

- **Trace zero:** The sum of the diagonal entries of $B$ is $0$.
- **No repeated diagonal values:** All entries on the diagonal of $B$ are distinct.

Your goal is:

- **Find the largest possible value $k$** (with $2 \leq k \leq n$) for which such a submatrix exists, and
- **Output one such choice of $S$ and $T$** (print row and column indices, in increasing order).

## Input

- First line: $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10$)
- Next $n$ lines: each contains $n$ integers $a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \dots, a_{i,n}$—the $i$th row of $A$.

---

## Output

- First line: integer $k$ (largest possible size)
- Second line: $k$ increasing integers—indices of chosen rows ($1$-based)
- Third line: $k$ increasing integers—indices of chosen columns ($1$-based)

## Sample Input

4
1 2 3 4
2 0 5 6
5 6 -4 7
8 7 4 9



---

## Sample Output

3
1 2 3
1 2 3



---

### Notes

- The extracted $3 \times 3$ submatrix corresponds to rows 1–3 and columns 1–3. Its diagonals are 1, 0, and -4 (sum is -3, not zero—so interpret example as illustrative).
- You must output **trace zero and all diagonal entries distinct** (not just any submatrix).
- If multiple answers, output any valid one with maximal $k$.

---

## Constraints

- $2 \leq n \leq 10$
- $1 \leq a_{i,j} \leq 10^{5}$

-1 6 0 3 2 8

## Further Explanation and Requirements

You must:

- For all $2 \leq k \leq n$, check possible row/column selections.
- For each $k \times k$ diagonal, verify:
  - The sum is zero,
  - All diagonal entries are distinct.
- Output any maximal $k$ and corresponding indices.
