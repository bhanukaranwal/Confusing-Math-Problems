# Problem 12 â€” Ramsey-Finding in Multicolored Complete Graphs

## Problem Statement

Given an integer $n$ ($5 \leq n \leq 12$) and $k$ colors ($2 \leq k \leq 5$), you are to color every edge of the complete undirected graph $K_n$ using $k$ colors.

Define a **monochromatic clique** as a subset of vertices all connected to each other, where all connecting edges share the same color.

Your task:

- Color the edges so that the **largest monochromatic clique** in the graph is as small as possible (i.e., minimize the maximal size of any monochromatic clique).
- Output your coloring (for each edge, specify its assigned color) and the size $r$ of the largest monochromatic clique produced.

## Input

- First line: $n~k$ ($5 \leq n \leq 12$, $2 \leq k \leq 5$)

---

## Output

- First line: $r$ (the smallest possible size of largest monochromatic clique over all possible colorings).
- Next $\binom{n}{2}$ lines: Each line is $u~v~c$, meaning edge between $u$ and $v$ ($1$-based indices) gets color $c$ ($1 \leq c \leq k$).

### Notes

- You must color every edge of $K_n$, using $k$ colors (not necessarily evenly).
- The goal is to minimize the largest monochromatic clique in the coloring.
- There may be many optimal colorings; any minimal $r$ and such coloring is accepted.

## Constraints

- $5 \leq n \leq 12$
- $2 \leq k \leq 5$
