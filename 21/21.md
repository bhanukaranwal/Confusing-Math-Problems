# Problem 21 — High-Dimensional Expansion, Cosystolic Gaps, and Extremal Subcomplexes

## Problem Statement

Let $q$ be a prime power ($3 \leq q \leq 11$) and $d$ be an integer with $2 \leq d \leq 4$.

Let $V$ be the set of points of the $(d-1)$‑dimensional projective space $\mathbb{P}^{d-1}(\mathbb{F}_q)$.  
Let $X$ be the **complete $(d-1)$‑dimensional simplicial complex** on vertex set $V$—that is, $X$ contains every subset of $V$ of size up to $d$ as a face.

Define:

1. **Induced $k$‑Subcomplex:** For $1 \leq k \leq d-1$, any subcomplex $Y \subset X$ containing all $j$‑faces of $X$ for $0 \leq j < k$, and some collection of $k$‑faces.

2. **Co-boundary Expansion Constant $h_{k}(Y)$:**  
   Given the $(k-1)$‑cochain space over $\mathbb{F}_2$,  
   $$
   h_k(Y) := \min_{\phi \notin B^{k-1}} \frac{\|\delta \phi\|}{\min_{\psi \in B^{k-1}} \|\phi + \psi\|}
   $$
   where $\|\cdot\|$ counts nonzero $k$‑faces and $B^{k-1}$ is the coboundary space of $(k-2)$‑cochains.

3. **Cosystolic Norm Gap $g_k(Y)$:**  
   The difference between the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the $k$‑dimensional up‑Laplacian $L^{\uparrow}_k$ and the largest eigenvalue of the $k$‑dimensional down‑Laplacian $L^{\downarrow}_k$.

Your tasks:

- Given $q$, $d$, and chosen $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq d-1$), **construct an induced $k$‑subcomplex $Y$ of $X$ that:**
  1. Minimizes $h_k(Y)$,
  2. Subject to (1), maximizes $g_k(Y)$.
- Output:
  - The set of $k$‑faces of $Y$ (one face per line, vertices in increasing index order).
  - The computed $h_k(Y)$ and $g_k(Y)$ to at least 7 decimal digits.
  - Verification data:
    - The $(k-1)$‑cochain that attains $h_k(Y)$ (in lex order of $(k-1)$‑faces).
    - The spectra of both up‑ and down‑$k$ Laplacians.

### Notes

- Vertices of $\mathbb{P}^{d-1}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ can be enumerated as equivalence classes of nonzero vectors of $\mathbb{F}_q^d$ up to scalar multiples.
- The complete $(d-1)$ complex contains all subsets of vertices of size $\leq d$.
- **h‑expansion** and **cosystolic gap** are high-dimensional analogues of graph expansion and spectral gap, generalizing Cheeger inequalities.
- The goal is to find the induced subcomplex that is “as non‑expanding as possible” while keeping the spectrum spread in the Laplacian large.
- Multiple valid optimal solutions may exist; any one is acceptable if it satisfies the conditions and is verified.

## Constraints

## Further Explanation and Requirements

You must:

- Generate $\mathbb{P}^{d-1}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ vertices,
- Build $X$, enumerate $k$‑faces,
- Select an induced subcomplex $Y$ minimizing $h_k$,
- Compute $g_k$ from spectra of up/down Laplacians,
- Output all required data, ensuring reproducibility.
