# Problem 17 â€” Automorphic Root Sets of Irreducible Integer Polynomials

## Problem Statement

Let $f(x) = x^d + a_{d-1} x^{d-1} + \dots + a_0$ be an irreducible monic polynomial of degree $d$ ($3 \leq d \leq 7$) with integer coefficients $|a_i| \leq 50$.

Let $R = \mathbb{Z}[x]/(f(x))$ denote the quotient ring.

Consider the set of $d$ distinct coset representatives modulo $f(x)$: $\{1, x, x^2, \dots, x^{d-1}\}$.

For every positive integer $m$ ($2 \leq m \leq 15$), define a subset $S \subseteq R$ (using only coset representatives), with $|S| = k$ ($2 \leq k \leq d$), such that:

1. **Automorphic Closure:** For every automorphism $\phi$ of $R$ as a $\mathbb{Z}$-algebra, $S$ is mapped to itself under $\phi$ (i.e., every automorphism permutes the elements of $S$).
2. **Zero-Sum-Free Divisibility:** The sum of the elements in $S$ is *never* divisible by $m$ in $R$ (i.e., sum modulo $m$ is nonzero in $R$).
3. **Maximality:** The set $S$ is as large as possible under these constraints for the given $f$ and $m$.

Your tasks:

- Given $f(x)$ (degree $d$, monic, irreducible, coefficients $a_i$), and integer $m$:
  - Construct all such maximal subsets $S$, and output their size and all members (in the form of monomials: $1$, $x$, $x^2$, etc.).
  - For each $S$, output the sum modulo $m$ in $R$ to verify the zero-sum-free constraint.
  - For each $S$, output a listing or characterization of the automorphism group of $R$.

## Input

- First line: $d~m$ ($3 \leq d \leq 7$, $2 \leq m \leq 15$)
- Second line: $a_{d-1}~a_{d-2}~\dots~a_0$ (space-separated, $|a_i| \leq 50$)

---

## Output

For each maximal $S$:
- First line: size $k = |S|$
- Second line: $S$ as space-separated monomials (out of $1$, $x$, $x^2$, ..., $x^{d-1}$)
- Third line: sum of $S$ modulo $m$ in $R$
- Fourth line: automorphism group of $R$ (as generators or structural description)

If multiple $S$ of maximal size exist, print each.

### Notes

- Only the coset representatives in $R$ are candidates for $S$.
- For automorphism group: give a brief characterization (e.g., "trivial", "generated by $x \mapsto -x$ modulo $f(x)$", etc.).
- Determining automorphic sets is a deep algebraic task for irreducible polynomials.

## Constraints

- $3 \leq d \leq 7$
- $2 \leq m \leq 15$
- $|a_i| \leq 50$ for $i=0,...,d-1$
- $f(x)$ is given as monic and irreducible over integers.

## Further Explanation and Requirements

- Find and output all maximal $S$ meeting criteria.
- For each $S$, detail sum mod $m$, and describe automorphism group per above.
- Focus on both algebraic structure and explicit combinatorial construction.
